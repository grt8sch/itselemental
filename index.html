      Potassium is very important to the body because it causes the heart to function and skeletal and muscle contracting. 
      Low potassium can cause low bone health, high blood pressure, heart disease, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
      Bananas have 400 mg of potassium in them. Potatoes have 609 mg of potassium making them a better source of potassium than bananas.
      Even though potassium is helpful for the body, you can have too much of it which is called hyperkalemia. Deprivation of potassium is called hypokalemia. 
      There are many more foods that are a good source of potassium including oranges, avocados and tomatoes. Fish, meat, and dairy products are also sources of potassium.
      Kids should take 3000-45000 mg of potassium a day. People 14 and older should take 4700 mg.
