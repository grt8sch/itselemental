    <h2>Fun Facts/Details</h2>
    <article>
      Potassium is very important to the body because it causes the heart to function and skeletal and muscle contracting. 
      Even though potassium is helpful for the body, you can have too much of it which is called hyperkalemia. Deprivation of potassium is called hypokalemia. 
      Low potassium can cause low bone health, high blood pressure, heart disease, and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.
      The healthy amount of potassium a day for a kid is 3000-4500 mg. The health amount for people 14 and older is 4700 mg.
      Bananas, the known food that has potassium, have 400 mg of potassium in them. Potatoes have 609 mg of potassium making them have more potassium than bananas.
      There are many more foods that are a good source of potassium including oranges, avocados and tomatoes. Fish, meat, and dairy products are also sources of potassium.
